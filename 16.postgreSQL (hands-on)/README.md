## What’s the Top Database in Mid-2025?

## What is this book about?
PostgreSQL is one of the fastest-growing open source object-relational database management systems (DBMS) in the world. As well as being easy to use, it’s scalable and highly efficient. In this book, you’ll explore PostgreSQL 17 and learn how to build database solutions using it. Complete with hands-on tutorials, this guide will teach you how to achieve the right database design required for a reliable environment.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand how users and connections are managed by running a PostgreSQL instance
* Interact with transaction boundaries using server-side programming
* Identify bottlenecks to maintain your database efficiently
* Create and manage extensions to add new functionalities to your cluster
* Choose the best index type for each situation


According to the **2025 Stack Overflow Developer Survey**, the **most used database** by developers is **PostgreSQL**, followed by **MySQL**, **SQLite**, and an accelerating **Redis**—with Redis experiencing an impressive **+8% year-over-year usage growth** ([Enstacked Technologies][1], [Stack Overflow Blog][2]).

Additionally, a separate **2025 industry ranking** confirms that PostgreSQL remains the **#1 most popular DBMS**, with MySQL in second place and SQLite and Redis following closely behind ([kingswaysoft.com][3]).
